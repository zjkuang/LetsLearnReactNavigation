========
Startup

(1) Create your app with TypeScript template
Run `npx react-native init <your-app-name> --template react-native-template-typescript`

In most cases it will create the app for you. But when I ran it, I got an error saying
  Error: Failed to install CocoaPods dependencies for iOS project, which is required by this template.
  Solution:
    brew upgrade cocoapods
      Trouble-shooting: Ignoring ffi-1.13.1 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine ffi --version 1.13.1

(2) Run it
`cd <your-app-name>`
`yarn ios`
`yarn android`

The first time running `yarn android` may fail with errors something like
  Could not determine the dependencies of task ':app:installDebug'.
Try to run android project from Android Studio for the first time and then quit Android Studio and let the Emulator remain open, run `yarn android` again.

(3) Push to GitHub
Create a new empty repository <your-app-name> in GitHub. (NO README, NO .gitignore, NOTHING!!!)
`cd <your-app-name>` and `git init` and `git add .` and `git commit -m 'initial'`
`git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-user-name>/<your-app-name>.git`
  (or `git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-github-user-name>/<your-app-name>.git`, depending on how your git was set up.)
`git push -u origin master`
(If you are using SourceTree, after the above steps, in SourceTree `New`/`Add Existing Local Repository`)

*** *** *** ***
Unless specifically mentioned, all the Terminal commands in this doc are supposed to be run from the folder of your app.
