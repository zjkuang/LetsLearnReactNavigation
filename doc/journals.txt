Startup

(1) Create your app with TypeScript template
Run `npx react-native init <your-app-name> --template react-native-template-typescript`

In most cases it will create the app for you. But when I ran it, I got an error saying
  Error: Failed to install CocoaPods dependencies for iOS project, which is required by this template.
  Solution:
    brew upgrade cocoapods
      Trouble-shooting: Ignoring ffi-1.13.1 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine ffi --version 1.13.1
      Solution: https://stackoverflow.com/a/65248326

(2) Run it
`cd <your-app-name>`
`yarn ios`
`yarn android`

The first time running `yarn android` may fail with errors something like
  Could not determine the dependencies of task ':app:installDebug'.
Try to run android project from Android Studio for the first time and then quit Android Studio and let the Emulator remain open, run `yarn android` again.

(3) Push to GitHub
Create a new empty repository <your-app-name> in GitHub. (NO README, NO .gitignore, NOTHING!!!)
`cd <your-app-name>` and `git init` and `git add .` and `git commit -m 'initial'`
`git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-user-name>/<your-app-name>.git`
  (or `git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-github-user-name>/<your-app-name>.git`, depending on how your git was set up.)
`git push -u origin master`
(If you are using SourceTree, after the above steps, in SourceTree `New`/`Add Existing Local Repository`)

*** *** *** ***
Unless specifically mentioned, all the Terminal commands in this doc are supposed to be run from the folder of your app.

Remove template contents

In App.tsx remove template contents.

Install react-navigation packages

Install some most frequently used packages from react-navigation, including stack, bottom-tabs, top-tabs and related packages
`yarn add @react-navigation/native react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs @react-navigation/material-top-tabs react-native-tab-view react-native-pager-view @react-navigation/drawer`
`cd ios && pod install && cd ..`
  (Each time we `yarn add ...` we need to run `cd ios && pod install && cd ..` to install the corresponding pods for iOS.)
