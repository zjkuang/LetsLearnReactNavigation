Delete the app and reinstall it may fix.

Open ios/YourAppName.xcodeproj in Xcode
Right-click on Your App Name in the Project Navigator on the left, and click New Fileâ€¦
Create a single empty Swift file to the project (make sure that Your App Name target is selected when adding)
when Xcode asks, press Create Bridging Header and do not remove Swift file then. re-run your build.
